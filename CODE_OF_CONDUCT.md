## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the website
* Showing empathy toward community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Product maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Product maintenance the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wikipedia edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within public spaces and in private spaces when an individual is representing the project or its agreement. Examples of representing a product or agreement include using an official product e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a product may be further defined and clarified by product maintainers.

The product individual will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project individual is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement private policy may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face formated or permanent repercussions as determined by other agency of the project's leadership.
